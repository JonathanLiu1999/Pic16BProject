# Pic16BProject

Abstract:
Every person will be interested in housing prices at least once in their life. There are many reasons for owning a house: having a place to live, using it as a rental property for income, or other potential reasons. My teammates and I want to see throughout the years, which geographic areas in California (or on a smaller scale) are the most dynamic in pricing and what the reasons are behind it. What are the social, economic, political sensitivities behind this? I believe we can understand and visualize the data from many angles. One very interesting angle will be how covid has influenced the housing market in California. This project can potentially both help predict housing price in new or existing neighborhoods and identify structural inequalities.
