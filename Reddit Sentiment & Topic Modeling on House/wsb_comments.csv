RAndrewOhge,1339603108.0,,,t2_7zffy,"Tyler Durden - 23 May 2015
Earlier this month we learned that in 21 out of the 26 OECD member countries that have a minimum wage, working 40 hours per week at the pay floor would not be sufficient to keep oneâs family out of poverty.
That rather stunning revelation comes as Democrats in the US push for a $12 minimum wage by 2020 and as pressure grows on companies like McDonaldâs to raise wages for its lowest-paid employees.
Of course rising minimum wages can also have the rather counterintuitive side effect of harming those theyâre meant to help because after all, when the cost of labor goes up, employers may simply fire people or, as we saw yesterday when McDonaldâs pledged to reduce the number of company-owned restaurants by 10% over the next several years, resort to other measures aimed at getting around pay floor hikes.
So while one can debate pros and cons of addressing abysmal wage growth by legislating a non-market-driven solution, what is not up for debate is this: itâs getting harder and harder to subsist above the poverty line for low-income workers.
In fact, as the following map shows, in no state can a minimum wage worker afford a one bedroom apartment.
Hereâs some color from a study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition:
Rents for apartments have risen nationally for 23 straight quarters.
As of the third quarter of 2014, rents were 15.2% higher than at the tail end of the Recession in 2009. Rising rents are an outcome of increased demand for rental housing.
One recent study of 11 major cities found double-digit growth in the number of renters in nine of the 11 cities between 2006 and 2013.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, the homeownership rate dropped to its lowest rate in twenty years and the rental vacancy rate fell to 7% as more households sought rental units.
The downward pressure on vacancy rates directly impacts the rental housing market, making landlords less willing to offer rent concessions and more likely to increase rents.
The tightening rental market has the most significant impact on low income renters.
So thank you Wall Street (and a hat tip to Alan Greenspan as well) for creating an entirely unsustainable housing bubble which finally collapsed on itself, turning a nation of homeowners into a nation of renters many of whom will now have to pony up everything they make each month to someone who may have gotten a landlord loan from Wall Street to buy up rental properties from home flippers who also got loans from Wall Street where some very clever investment bankers are busy securitizing these landlord and home flipper loans in order to sell billions in new ABS on the way to recreating the very same bubble only to have it burst all over again.

interstellar-blue,,,,t2_31vkm1jp,"There are a few standards out there for determining a mortgage loan youâd be qualified for. Most fall in the range of 2 - 3 times your annual income, or simply ensuring that your monthly mortgage payment doesnât exceed 30% of your monthly income. So, for one, it depends on how much money you make a year. Based on your submission, it doesnât sound like you make much at all. ~$1,200 a month is less than $15k a year. If a $30k - $45k house exists, itâs cause itâs in shambles. As it stands, you canât afford more than ~$400 a month for housing. Thatâs a tiny budget. 

Aside from this, banks use credit to determine their risk in lending you money. Without that, I doubt youâll get a mortgage the conventional way, unless you find a high risk lender who will give you a super high interest rate and 0% down â which I donât recommend. You canât afford a house as it is based on the numbers above. Plus, with no renterâs history, that makes a lender even less likely to loan you anything. 

Youâre better off renting a room or having a live-in job. In other words, getting a job that provides you housing on-site. There are both paid and volunteer sources that do this. Otherwise you may need to bunk with a friend. Sorry dude. I make $30k and canât afford a house.

Raillerie,,,,t2_3kdarx4e,"This question in and of itself is very complicated. Deciding to own a home is a huge responsibility. Whether or not itâs a good idea to buy depends on the area that you live in. Weâre currently in a sellers market which means Home values are overinflated. We could be looking at another crash in the next 5 to 10 years. I personally wouldnât buy property right now. But, it is true that when you rent youâre basically giving your money to your landlord.  But in return you donât have to do maintenance on the home that you live in. From personal experience homes can be extremely expensive to maintain. Especially if you canât afford to buy one thatâs already been remodeled.  I would answer the following questions then make a decision.

1. Do you have 20% of home value to put down?
2. Do you have not only the monthly payment, but also enough to cover the taxes and insurance on a home?
3. Are you knowledgeable enough to do your own home repairs?
4. If you are planning to buy a fixer-upper, can you do those improvements yourself?
5. If you donât have the skills to do those improvements yourself, do you know enough to supervise your contractor?
6. Are you OK giving up your free time to maintain your home?
7. Are you secure enough in your job that there is no risk of losing it should the economy turn?

My husband and I have owned our home for around 15 years, we have done extensive improvements on it. I can say itâs been extremely expensive and time-consuming, even though my husband knows how to do the work himself.  We have hired contractors to do some work for us, but unfortunately if my husband had not been knowledgeable enough to spot errors, there wouldâve been a lot of things done wrong.  Our first remodel project was a complete gut and redesign of the kitchen.  We did 90% of the work ourselves and it cost us around $35-$40,000. Had we hired somebody to do it it probably wouldâve been twice that.  Iâm not saying home ownership is not worth it in the long run, but like any investment, it should be viewed from the long term (20 years or more).  When you ask âhow long should we stay in it?â Thatâs not an easy question to answer, generally you have to stay in a property for three years in order to avoid paying capital gains taxes on any value above the purchase price. But of course he would have to talk to your tax accountant about that.  I would recommend buying with the plan to either stay in the home and improve it over many many years in order to sell closer to retirement.  Or buy something you can live in without improving. Yes an unimproved home will go up in value over the long run but weâre talking at least 10 years if not more depending on home values in your area.  And even if you plan not to do major home improvements there will still be fix-it projects and maintenance. Toilets break, electrical goes out, plumbing leaks, flooring gets damaged, etc. you will still need to plan for unexpected maintenance.

Just go into buying a home with open eyes.  Home inspections before purchase certainly donât catch everything. Inspectors canât see the electrical or plumbing behind the drywall, or what might be hidden by carpet, or a new coat of paint.  Be your own advocate.

I-Downloaded-a-Car,,,,t2_hwveh,"TL;DR The green space is the reason for the circles. If you built square plots the same distance from the road as these are it would take more area to build these houses than there is total land in this picture. The rest of this post is just an explaination for how I figured that out.

I'm not an architect, so I'll just start off by saying that. However, I found this interesting so I'm going to try my best to come up with some semblance of explanation.

Firstly let's establish scale. It doesn't actually matter but it is nice to have a frame of reference to go off of. If my knowledge of vans hasn't failed me [the white van right here](https://imgur.com/0P27jqC) is a Mercedes Sprinter, 20 feet long. This is backed up by the width of the road being about the same as the van, 20 feet is a reasonable width for a path like this one.

That gives us an established scale. To avoid the perspective warping the numbers all further measurements will be done on the bottom right group of houses. It is assumed that all plots and all circles are the same.

Each circle has 16 houses in it. each plot is about 7 vans long and 2.5 vans wide at the base. (50 feetx140 feet). The plots are close enough to isosceles triangles that we can use that property to do the calculations. A = 1/2 * B * H. A = 3500 square feet. So now we know each plot has an area of 3500 square feet. If there are 16 houses per circle each circle has an area of 56,000 square feet. There are 9 circles so the total plot size of everything is 504,000â¬ square feet. The rest is green space.

there are a total of 171 houses shown in this picture, each with a lot size of 3500 square feet. This lot size wouldn't work very well if these were square lots because that would mean the plots could only be the square root of 3500 or about 59 feet per side. Because these houses are on triangular plots it is instead possible to set them back an entire 140 feet from the road, while still only sacrificing 9 feet of spacing between each house. The circular design also allows for the houses to all have some amount of green space behind them, instead of having a road or more houses.

Let's suppose you want to build these on rectangular lots but you also want to have the same 140 feet of offset from the road. To do that you'd have to give every single house 7000 square feet. Or exactly twice what they take right now. Resulting in a substantial amount less green space. Let's figure out how much green space that would give you now. To do this we'll use the bottom two circles.


[If you draw a box around the bottom two, starting at the highest point on the left side](https://imgur.com/X8ieO4V) and ending at the bottom of the image you'll find that it's 35 vans x 20 vans, 700 square vans, or 280,000 square feet. To get an accurate picture of the exact size of the circles I'm going to measure all the way into the middle of the driveway instead of the end of the lot. That produces a measurement of 8 vans. 160 feet. So the radius of our circles is 160 feet. Ïr^2 = 3.14*160^2 = 80,384. 80384*2 = â­160,768â¬ square feet for both circles. That leaves us with 119,232 square feet of green space for those two instances, or â­42.58â¬% of the area is green space. Now obviously we can't build 50x140 square lots on the amount of land. It would take approximately twice as much land to do that, going off the lot sizes we determined earlier. That would beâ­ 321,536â¬ square feet required to build the houses with square lots. Or 12.92% more land than is currently being used for both the green space and the houses.",,1560743132,,,erdigpk,t3_c0uxpy,,t3_c0uxpy,,1560743133.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,[],,[],,,text,False,{},False,False,True,/r/housing/comments/c0uxpy/why_are_these_houses_distributed_in_this_way/erdigpk/,True,0.0,1560876538.0,,,,,,,,

If you go the Airbnb route, I would suggest booking one month in advance to get the best rooms for the cheapest amount.

But Berlinâs âco-housing cultureâ shows that a cityâs future doesnât have to go that way. By Sarah van Gelder - Apr 14, 2017| News Report

San Francisco used to be famous for its tolerant and creative culture. 

These days, itâs more famous for its astronomical cost of living; the average rent as of February for a one-bedroom apartment was $3,368. 

Cities with vibrant arts, music, and social scenes are being hit hard by gentrification. 

The pattern repeats itself in cities everywhere â artists, nonprofit leaders, young people, DIY culture, urban farmers, and small-scale entrepreneurs begin revitalizing a city. 

Then real estate speculators arrive, and before long the people who created the scene and many long-time residents find themselves priced out, leaving only the super wealthy â and the homeless.

But this isnât the only future a hip city can have, and Berlin is a case in point. 

Anarchists for years have been squatting in abandoned buildings and on open land. 

Cooperatives and a variety of other shared living arrangements offer affordable options. 

Social movements have emerged to protect these approaches and to counter displacement of poor and middle-class residents.

While on a speaking tour of Germany, I visited Spreefeld, a housing cooperative built in downtown Berlin. 

The car-free community is located on the Spree River, but instead of reserving waterfront access for residents only, the creators included ways to welcome the public to walk through the grounds. 

Residents work closely with the neighboring squat called Teepee Land to facilitate public access to the river and to both communities. 

The co-op spent years convincing the city to allow a food forest along the nearby river walk. 

Co-op members hope the concept, if it works, can spread along other stretches of the walk.

The Spreefeld model comes from what author and urban planner Michael LaFond calls a âco-housing culture.â 

LaFond, founder of the Institute for Creative Sustainability, is an American living in Berlin who helped found Spreefeld and now lives there.

Cooperatives have a history reaching back to the mid-19th century in Berlin, LaFond told me. 

He estimates that as many as 250 or 300 squats have existed at some point since the 1970s in both East and West Berlin. 

Young people, especially anarchists, occupied vacant buildings as a way to live for little or nothing, and to save the old, beautiful buildings of Berlin from demolition in the name of urban renewal. 

The movement became powerful enough that city government was unable to evict people easily from the squats. 

Instead, city officials worked with the squatters to purchase the properties from absentee owners and offered funding to those willing to refurbish the buildings.

Many of these former squats are now cooperatives.

The founders of Spreefeld were influenced by this self-help culture and by the Scandinavian co-housing model that helped launch the co-housing movement in the United States. 

But the Spreefeld residents also brought their own ideas.

LaFond invited me to lunch in the common kitchen that serves the 21 units in his building.

âWhen you come home in the evening, thereâs food on the table and on the stove,â he told me. 

âOften youâll find people sitting here at the big table, and you can sit and talk and relax at the end of the day.â

The two lower floors in these buildings are devoted to community and public uses. 

There are office spaces for co-working, workshops, and galleries. 

A day care center attracts families from the neighborhood. 

Spaces for music, yoga, and dance are available to both community members and the public, as well as a kitchen, a large gathering space, and a woodworking shop.

Some parts of the building are designed to evolve as needs change. When the recent refugee crisis hit, residents converted two spaces into apartments to house two newly arrived families.

The residents here include teachers, health care workers, artists, and small-business and nonprofit managers, many of whom would struggle to find affordable housing if they didnât live at Spreefeld. 

Some keep costs down by choosing tiny private spaces and making use of shared kitchens and bathrooms, while those with higher incomes look for ways to help cover expenses that might be a burden for their neighbors.

Berlinâs creative culture is under tremendous pressure as real estate speculators from around the globe buy up apartment buildings. 

But a culture of resistance and grassroots revitalization is putting a brake on gentrification, helping to protect the residentsâ right to their city.

river-wind,1184890879.0,,,t2_27vr5,"You can rent an apartment as a green card holder - or even buy a house.  (My step-family are all green card holders).  Once you have signed a contract, you may be able to move in right away (if the apartment is already available; otherwise, you would start renting the 1st day of the following month).

You will most likely pay the first and last month's rent up front, as well as a security deposit.  At the end of your rental contract, if you have not broken anything in the apartment, you should get your security deposit back.  Regular wear and tear normally cannot be deducted from the security deposit - so if a landlord attempts to charge you for repainting the apartment, you can fight back.  If you break off the sink's faucet handle, they will deduct the cost of repairing that from the deposit you get back.

You could also purchase a house and not rent, but there is much more risk involved.  I would recommend against that in most areas of the US at the moment, as house values are generally fairly high, and the fees that go with buying a house would likely make it more expensive for the first year than renting would be.

river-wind,1184890879.0,,,t2_27vr5,"It depends completely on the landlord/the owner of the property, and on the laws of the State you plan to move to.  Your job offer will help, and the employer may have some resources via the Human Resources department to assist with relocation - including helping you find a place to live.  Finding a long-term rental in one day will be hard - it would be better to plan ahead. Do research via the internet, and see if you can find a month-to-month rental near your new job, with the plan to look for a new place once you have been in your job for a few months.

I have been a landlord in the US to one degree or another for 20 years.  When someone applies to rent my house or apartment, I give them back a basic rental application, which includes some basic questions such as:

*Prior living location with contact information for a reference
*Current Employment info with contact info, rough salary amount
*Anything I should know about (credit problems or criminal history)
*Permission to run a background and credit check

So long as they can afford the rent with their current job and don't have criminal history which they didn't disclose in the application, I'm pretty easy to work with.  If an applicant came to me with no credit history, as a landlord it would be very risky for me to accept them and let them rent a property.  That won't mean that you will get a no answer, but it does mean your monthly rent may be higher, to cover the extra risk.

That said, many landlords work with people who don't have a credit history, or have a poor credit history.  Especially if you are moving to an area with many immigrants, this will be a common issue, and more people will be familiar with how to handle it.  Talk to locals who have been through it to learn how to not be taken advantage of!  Learn the Tenant-Landlord laws for the state you are moving to, and know both your rights as a renter, and your legal responsibilities.

If you are approved, *read your lease agreement*, and if you know a lawyer, have them read it too.  Just because something is written down doesn't mean it is legal.  Make sure you and the landlord both understand what each is responsible for per the laws of the state you will be living in.  Be nice, be polite, but make sure they know you understand the process, and you will be less likely to be taken advantage of.  

Understand what a security deposit is, how it works, and what you need to do to get the money back when you move out.  Make sure the landlord is putting that money into an escrow account with both their name *and* your name attached to it.  Don't let them steal your security deposit if you don't break anything while living in the home - normal expected wear-and-tear almost never comes out of the security deposit.

Get renter's insurance.  It's not too expensive, but will cover any lost items in case the apartment burns down, and can potentially save you from a lot of difficulty should that occur.

In the US, a good credit history is very important to have - a good credit score can save you significant money.  Given your time frame, find a place to live by trying lots of places, be honest and up front and expect that some landlords won't talk to you without a credit history.

Then build a credit score so you can find a new, better, and hopefully cheaper place the next year!

http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2011/01/10/whats-a-credit-score-an-intro-to-credit-reports-and-credit-scores/

A method I've used to help some tenants improve their credit scores

1) Save $1,000  
2) Go to a bank and deposit that $1,000 into a savings account.
3) Get a secured loan from the same bank in the amount of $1,000 (the loan officer may be confused.  The key is that this will be a secured loan against the deposited money as collateral, so no credit check needed).  
4) Do not spend the loan money on anything else!  
5) Pay the monthly payments on the loan using the loan money.  Do not pay ahead.
6) In ~12 months, the loan is paid off (plus a bit of interest), and you get your original $1,000 deposit back.

If you complete that, you will have a much improved credit score due to paying off ""revolving credit"" on time.  Add to that having open credit cards which you use for some purchases during a month but are *never* late on paying back, you will be able to apply for a new apartment from a much better position than you are in when you start out.  Keep in mind that a good credit score reflects your potential as a low-risk money-making target for companies.  So being completely frugal and responsible (no loans, no credit cards, no rent or mortgage) can actually hurt your credit score.  The best score comes from lots of approved but unused credit (aka ""available credit""), and a perfect history of paying borrowed money and rent on-time.",0.0,1490898499,,0.0,dfm6dz6,t3_62cj42,1.0,t3_62cj42,39314.0,1491919187.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TuftsJumbo1,1477944965.0,,,t2_12i7rg,"""..The residents are grateful to Thomas Safran &amp; Associates for that, and the ones I spoke to are thrilled with the wall-to-wall upgrades in the 283 rooms and all the common areas.

But more than that, theyâre happy to have beaten the odds in a region where  thousands are on waiting lists for existing affordable senior housing. With many new properties, you literally have to win a lottery to get in.

Jordan Pynes, president of Safran, said the company has built 3,000 affordable housing units in the last 11 years, mostly for seniors, and bought the Wilshire property in 2015.

âWhen we open a new property, weâll have thousands of applicants for every unit available,â said  Pynes.

Wilshire Towers is a Section 8 building. Low-income tenants pay a little less than $300 monthly â one-third of their Social Security income â on rent. Market rates in the heart of Koreatown run much, much higher. But the project pencils out for Safran because a tax credit is available when you develop affordable housing, and Pynes said the companyâs mission is to do good along with doing well...""",0.0,1484405924,,0.0,dcf1rbm,t3_5nxsb3,1.0,t3_5nxsb3,73.0,1486042651.0,1,,housing,t5_2qh7e,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No, you should not be expected to pay anything back. These aren't loans, here's the main types of affordable housing:

-public housing. Owned and managed by a Public Housing Authority (local or sometimes state government agency). Requires that tenants have a certain income to maintain affordability. You generally pay 30% of your income towards rent.

-housing funded by low income housing tax credits. Private developers  receive tax credits from the government in order to build a residential development. The money comes with a land use restriction agreement--for a certain number of years, the development will have to keep a certain % of apartments at a certain rent. The rent is based on local median income, so if the development is in a nice area they might not be all that affordable, to be honest.

-Section 8/housing choice voucher. Administered by public housing authorities or occasionally other government agencies. This is a voucher program where the government gives you a subsidy to use towards rent at any place the landlord is willing to accept the vouchers. These have maximum limits and certain requirements for the apartment. Section 8 typically has waiting lists that are reeeaaally long.

Those are the three big ones! There are many others as well, but these are the main ones people are talking about with ""affordable housing"". For any of these programs, you pay the subsidized/lowered rent and that's it. No paying extra later. 

I also just wanted to say you should definitely know your rights. Look for a low income housing advocacy or fair housing organization in your state/area and see if they have a pamphlet on renters'/tenants' rights. Know what people can and cannot do to you. Know what you owe and when. Management at these places can be a bit rough so be your own advocate. It's not all doom and gloom but I've heard some horror stories working where I do!

Hope my ramblings are helpful!

No, living in low income housing (I assume you mean public housing?) will not affect your career. These resources exist for a reason, there may be a bit of a stigma around public or assisted housing culturally but that's about it.

As for being 'charged later', not sure what you mean by that. There are lots of types of low income housing--public housing (owned and operated by a housing authority), units funded with low income housing tax credits, units funded with other federal state or local housing programs, and there's a lot of plain old rent assistance programs as well. A lot of low income housing is actually privately owned and managed but with requirements for the income of the tenant to maintain affordability. You should reach out to the state housing agency where you plan on moving and even the city/town where you plan on going to find out about these programs locally. Look online, they may have a list of all the units they've funded through these programs. If government doesn't help, there's also a load of private (nonprofits usually) sources for housing assistance.

Is that like houses rather than apartments? I'm wondering if they would be any cheaper than the apartments in my area, or if they have strict leases, since I might hopefully be out of here within 6-12 months. I couldn't seem to find anything about ADUs in Iowa though. I could ask someone about it, but I have no idea who you're expected to talk to about this stuff in Iowa.


My credit isn't great, since I'm a little too good with money, so I never saw a need to get a credit card and spend money I don't have. which means I've got pretty weak credit. It was almost 700, but then one of the apartments I applied to did a hard credit check on me, and my credit score dropped down like 20 points. Still, it's not too bad, at least I think so.

Yeah, I feel a little reluctant about mentioning any physical issues to potential employers, because I know that just because they're not supposed to discriminate against someone doesn't mean there's any way to prove when they're doing it. I wouldn't need any accommodations wherever I lived, and I would just mention it to places that are only for people with a disability or are elderly, so that would just give me more options as I otherwise wouldn't even qualify to apply there.

muieenLNF,1519825258.0,,,t2_z7hqkvr,"I deal with a lot of HCVP (Housing Choice Voucher Program) in DC, which used to be Section 8. The way it works is you go through application process (can take x years). Then the local government (in my case DCHA), will grant you a voucher if you qualify. Now for Dc, you can only apply the voucher to properties that are Below the rent maximum for that neighborhood. So in DC, you would have to consult this site: http://www.dchousing.org/rent_hcvp.aspx to let you know what max rent is for each neighborhood. 

From there you apply to those places. If your credit is above a certain amount then you are able to get in. Specific to DC there are very few reasons you can deny a tenants application without it being considered discrimination. 

Now hereâs where things get complicated DCHA, the landlord and tenant have to figure out a crapload of paperwork and inspections. The inspections require the property to be at a very high level of quality, which you can find on DCHAâs website. After like a month of all that tenant finally gets in, tenant pays a max of 30% of their income. 

Other parts where things get messy. Some people who get awarded a voucher have failing credit of below 600 (from my experience landlords refuse to rent out to those with credit scores below 600). The reason for that is that the tenants still have to pay utilities. If they miss utility payments for things like water, DC water can actually put a lien on your property because the tenant did not pay. Creates a headache of a situation which is why most landlords refuse to below a certain credit score. 

Other things that make it a mess, thereâs very little coherent information of DCHAâs website to really explain the HCVP process so I donât know whatâs going on, and no one seems to know whatâs going on.
